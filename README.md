## Project Overview

This project is designed to efficiently manage tasks and projects. Below are some screenshots showcasing the key features of the application:

### Workspace
![Workspace](photo/workspace.png)
The workspace provides an overview of all projects across different organizations. Users can sign in using Google and be assigned roles as admins or workers. All actions are logged under activity. Users can build their own dashboards or use predesigned models to track their projects. Each dashboard offers access to a general dashboard view, calendar view, Gantt chart, and importance view.

### Calendar View

### User Story

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
